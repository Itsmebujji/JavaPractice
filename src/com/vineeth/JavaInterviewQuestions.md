Java Design Patterns:

Creational Design Pattern:
Provide solution to instantiate an object

Singleton Pattern:
Instance or object will be created by only once. Single object for class for lifetime of application. 
Object will create once, another can’t create, instead need to set the object values.
Unit testing -> will be difficult (we can’t mock)

Factory Pattern: 
This pattern used to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client. Instead, the client interacts with a common interface, and factory class decides which subclass object to instantiate and return based on the input or configuration.

Abstract Factory design pattern:
